## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- npm

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd usms
npm run install:all
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
# Server
cp server/.env.example server/.env
# Edit server/.env with your MongoDB URI, JWT secrets, email config

# Client
cp client/.env.example client/.env
```

### 3. Run Development

```bash
# Option A: Run both together
npm run dev

# Option B: Run separately
npm run dev:server   # http://localhost:5000
npm run dev:client   # http://localhost:5173
```

### 4. Create Admin User

Register via `/register` and set `role: "admin"` directly in MongoDB, or use the API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Admin","email":"admin@usms.edu","password":"Admin@1234","role":"admin"}'
```

## Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build and run
docker-compose up --build -d

# Stop
docker-compose down
```

---

## Deployment

- **Backend**: Render / Railway — set env vars, point to MongoDB Atlas
- **Frontend**: Vercel / Netlify — set `VITE_API_URL` to backend URL
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas free tier

---

## Architecture

```
Request → Express Router
       → Auth Middleware (JWT verify)
       → Role Middleware (RBAC check)
       → Controller (request/response)
       → Service (business logic)
       → Model (MongoDB via Mongoose)
       → Response

Frontend: Component → dispatch(action) → Redux Slice → API call → Store update → UI re-render
```

---

## Security

- JWT access tokens (15min) + refresh tokens (7 days)
- bcryptjs password hashing (12 rounds)
- Helmet.js security headers
- express-rate-limit (100 req/15min, 10 auth req/15min)
- express-mongo-sanitize (NoSQL injection prevention)
- CORS restricted to client URL
- Input validation with express-validator
- HTTP-only cookies for token storage
